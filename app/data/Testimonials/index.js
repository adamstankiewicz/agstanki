    text: 'As a faculty member at the University of Hartford, I was fortunate to have Adam in my introduction to web development and user-experience design course during the Spring of 2012. Even then, it was clear to me that he had extraordinary technical abilities compared to his peers, a drive to learn independently, and a keen interest in the investigation and analysis of the human element of systems.\nHe is well-versed in web-development and has had several industry internships, which allow him to build interface prototypes with ease. His additional coursework for his psychology minor have given him knowledge about human learning and behavior along with practical skills in applied statistics and research design. Iâ€™ve personally seen him bring these skills to bear on research projects in my lab.\nOne of his first tasks in my lab was to prototype a web-based anchored collaboration platform involving streaming educational video content for flipped classes and hybrid/online courses. Not only was he able to build the majority of a workable first prototype in a single semester, but he also demonstrated his ability to identify and reason about design decisions and their potential impact on learners and instructors. His efforts on this project were instrumental in providing a proof of concept for an exploratory NSF grant proposal.',

    text: 'I had the privilege to manage Adam over the summer of 2013 during his internship program at Carbonite. Over that period of time Adam demonstrated exceptional technical skills that I would consider well ahead of his years of education. He was immediately comfortable with our Agile processes and the tight knit team environment he joined. Within the first few days he was contributing directly to our code base, and quickly came up to speed with much of our code domain.\nHe has a quiet professional demeanor, as well as the confidence to share his opinions with team members much his senior. He asked question, listened and took direction very well. Throughout the summer he worked on independent projects as well as contributed to team projects. Overall I highly recommend Adam and am very confident he will succeed in whatever technical and professional challenges he tackles in the future.',

    text: 'Adam joined ForeSite as an intern for the Development Team, but it feels as if he has been working with us for years. His well-rounded skill set really brings a lot to the table - assisting us with various graphic design, web development, and maintenance projects.\nVery bright and always eager to learn, Adam naturally fits in with the team, and always welcomes any task that comes his way with a smile. It is such a pleasure to work with such a talented person, and I am honored to be able to help him learn a few things as he continues to grow his skills within the field of web development.',
